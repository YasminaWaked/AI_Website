                    <p id="household-p">Right now, most of our chores and daily tasks are done by us. Some of them are quite tedious and boring. They ruin our productivity, because they simply must be done, and do not leave time for us to do the important things.</p>

                    <h3 id="transportation-h3">Transportation Optimization</h3>
                    <p id="transportation-p">Traffic is not always managed efficiently, causing us to be late to places we need to be. Cars are currently driven by humans, which is not always safe. Driving requires attention and focus, and even then, that is not enough to prevent accidents from happening. As a result, people die and get injured.</p>

                    <h3 id="workplace-h3">Workplace Enhancement</h3>
                    <p id="workplace-p">Daily tasks at work are repetitive and boring. They waste our time. Tasks that we need to finish every day need time and are not always scheduled according to the time needed, leaving us with either too little or too much time to finish work. Some decisions regarding the company cannot be made without considering all possibilities, which takes a lot of time as well. All of this disrupts workflow and damages productivity.</p>

                    <p id="education-p">Not all students learn in the same way, and teachers cannot accomodate each student's needs. Current learning methods are inefficient.</p>

                    <p id="entertainment-p">Finding something that suits your personal tastes is hard. Almost like finding a single needle in a hay stack. Services are not always efficient, and customers become impatient quickly, especially in modern-day society, where everything is expected to be fast.</p>

                    <p id="privacy-p">Data privacy is a sensitive topic, and we all doubt the safety of our data on the internet. That is because humans are in charge of managing said data, and they may exploit it for their own gain.</p>

                    <p id="jobDisplacement-p">Right now, finding a job is not easy. The workplace is also potentially a toxic environment, with prejudice and discrimination always a problem.</p>

                <div id="bias">
                    <h3 id="bias-h3">Bias and Fairness</h3>
                    <p id="bias-p">Humans have a habit of throwing away morals and ethics when faced with competition or a difficult problem. We also tend to be very impulsive and impatient when making decisions. For us, it is always the question: 'What are we willing to do in order to get what we want?' Some of us do not see the problem in putting others down in order to feel superior, or lying and cheating to get that promotion.</p>

                    <p id="collaboration-p">Right now, humans are only starting to integrate AI into their daily life. We still have doubts about its accuracy and its abilities. Some of us even believe that AI will takeover the world, and are terrified to use it.</p>

                    <p id="norms-p">Society has come a long way in these past few decades. Our lives have changed darastically compared to the 1980s, before the internet was introduced. Now, we can connect with anyone in the world, get to know them, and understand their culture. Some trends that someone came up with in the UK could take the world by storm, resulting in people all the way on the other side of the world participating in them.</p>

                    <p id="takeover-p">It is unlikely that AI will takeover the world, at least not anytime soon. This is because a considerable percentage of the population is weary of this, and are therefore very careful when using AI and social media. Campaigns about cyber security have also become a common event. As long as we do not over-train and let AI get out of hand, it can definitely become a benefit and change our world for the better.</p>
